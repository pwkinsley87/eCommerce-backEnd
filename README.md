E-Commerce Back End 

This is a program designed to provide e-commerce functionality to a business' website using MySQL, Express and Sequelize. The program is not full functional. When it is, a link to a walkthrough video will be added to this README. Currently, the project is non-functional, but I plan on returning to it upon completion of the course and fixing it.
